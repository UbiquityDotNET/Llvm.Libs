<!--
This is the version of the binaries generated by this repo. While it generally will
match the underlying LLVM version numbers, that is NOT a requirement and thus it
is distinct. The Major number will match the LLVM major number, the Minor number probably
will also match, but the "patch" is where things can diverge. It will match for an initial
build of a given release of LLVM but may increment pas that.
Attributes:
    BuildMajor - Major portion of the build number
    BuildMinor - Minor portion of the build number
    BuildPatch - Patch portion of the build number
    PreReleaseName - PreRelease Name of the CSemVer
    PreReleaseNumber - PreRelease Number of the CSemVer
    PreReleaseFix - PreRelease Fix of the CSemVer
